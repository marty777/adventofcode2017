# adventofcode2017
[Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) in Swift 5.

To run:

		$ git clone https://github.com/marty777/adventofcode2017
		$ cd adventofcode2017
		$ swift run adventofcode2017
		
Puzzle input and example input files should be placed in the ./Data directory. e.g. ./Data/Day01/input.txt, ./Data/Day02/input.txt, etc.

Note that all tests expect an input text file, even for single-value inputs on puzzle days that don't provide one for download. Insert your input value in the first line of a text file and save to the appropriate directory.
